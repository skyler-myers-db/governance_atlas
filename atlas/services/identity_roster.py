"""Workspace identity roster — the ground-truth set of principals that actually
exist in the Databricks account.

The governance store historically accepted any free-text email as an owner /
steward / assignee / reviewer. That let fabricated principals
(e.g. "finance-steward@entrada.ai") get linked to assets even though no such
account user exists. The owner mandated that only real account members be
linkable.

This module is the single normalization point for that rule:

- ``get_roster(uc)`` enumerates real workspace users + service principals via
  the existing UC/workspace client and caches the snapshot server-side for
  ``_ROSTER_TTL_S`` seconds (keyed by warehouse so multiple targets never share
  a bucket).
- ``RosterSnapshot.is_member`` / ``.principal_kind`` answer the membership
  question. Service principals are members (they ARE account principals).
- ``validate_principal`` raises a ``PrincipalNotInWorkspaceError`` carrying a
  clean 400 message for the write paths.
- ``account_member_flag`` powers the read-side honesty badge.

Graceful degradation: if the roster API is unavailable in the runtime (the
workspace client raises, or returns nothing), the snapshot is marked
``available=False``. Callers then SKIP the reject-on-write check (fail-open) and
the read flag reports ``None`` rather than a false negative. Nothing is hidden.
