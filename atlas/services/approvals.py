"""Approval gate for governance metadata mutations.

Non-admin writers (role=writer) propose metadata changes; the gate
intercepts their writes, stashes the full proposed patch on a pending
change_request (reusing the existing v5 task-backed workflow), and
returns a `queued` envelope instead of applying to Unity Catalog.
Stewards and admins bypass the gate and apply directly.

When an approver flips a queued request to `approved`, the consumer
re-reads the stored patch and applies it with `bypass_approval=True`
so the same service helper runs — no duplicate "apply" code path.

Design notes
------------
- The patch payload lives in `new_uc_tags` (the `new_uc_tags_json`
  column). We wrap it in a `{__kind__, __payload__}` envelope so the
  consumer can dispatch by kind (`asset-metadata`, `column-metadata`,
  etc.) and re-inflate the Pydantic model cleanly.
- We do NOT gate notification mutations — those aren't content
  changes. Callers opt in by invoking `gate_asset_metadata_patch`
  before invoking the write; helpers that don't call the gate simply
  go through, which is the correct behavior for non-content paths.
- Stewards bypass. The previous iteration accidentally queued
  steward edits to themselves; the fix is to include "steward" in
  `APPROVAL_BYPASS_ROLES`. Only `writer` is gated.
