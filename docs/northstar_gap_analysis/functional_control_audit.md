# Functional Control Audit

Status: reopened and blocking after the 2026-05-02 false-signoff review.

The previous `0` open control state is invalid. Current local prototype reports may
remain as reproduction/capture-health artifacts, but they cannot close
customer-facing product readiness rows. Each visible control now needs current
live/runtime evidence with `mockApi=false`, or a truthful disabled/unavailable
state recorded in the reopened audit.

This ledger is the control-level companion to `full_page_audit.md`. It tracks
visible controls that must be exercised, backed, truthfully unavailable, or disabled
before any `northstar/*` page can receive functional signoff.

Authoritative reading rule: unchecked reopened rows at the top of each page section
are the current blockers. Historical checked rows below those reopened blocks are
retained only as prior evidence history; they do not close the reopened controls and
must not be read as current functional completion proof.

Current closure evidence required:

- None of the reopened customer-facing control rows currently has closure-grade
  evidence unless that row cites current live/runtime evidence with `mockApi=false`
  from the active reopened epoch, or records a truthful disabled/unavailable outcome.
- Historical prototype, mock, fixture, local-only, or intercepted reports below are
  retained only for reproduction, capture health, or prior-state debugging. They do
  not close product-readiness controls, even when an older bullet says `passed`.
- Older live Databricks reports below prove only the build, deployment, and
  interaction IDs named in their own bullet. They must be rerun for the active epoch
  before they can close reopened controls.

Active current control evidence:

- `docs/northstar_visual_qa/live-runtime-current-v215-full-functional-datapact-test-2026-05-04/prototype-current-report.json`
  is the active all-route local-runtime control report for build
  `frontend-39d0070a8f87`; it has `mockApi=false`, `interactionCount=48`, and two
  expected invalid structured-search `400` checks. It is not deployed Databricks App
  proof.
- `docs/northstar_visual_qa/live-runtime-current-v216-performance-datapact-test-2026-05-04/performance-report.json`
  is local runtime performance evidence for build `frontend-39d0070a8f87`; it has
  `budgetPassed=true` and explicitly warns that it is not deployed Databricks App
  proof.
- Functional reviewer recheck on v215 remains BLOCKED for any row not explicitly
  closed with current control-level evidence, deployed proof, or a truthful
  disabled/unavailable outcome.

Historical reproduction and non-closing evidence inventory:

- Historical comparison screenshots: see `global_current_evidence_dir` in
  `docs/northstar_gap_analysis/reference_manifest.json`; as of this reopened audit it
  points to local prototype-mock comparison evidence and cannot close rows.
- Historical all-route functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/all-functional-v122-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024`, `1440x900`, and `1280x720` with `24` route captures and
  `132` interaction records. Its cross-page shared-control interaction inventories
  `322` visible controls at each reviewed viewport, separates `90` to `91`
  hidden/accessibility-only controls, records `0` uncovered visible controls, verifies
  Atlas AI markdown rendering, and explicitly records that this is local
  prototype-mock evidence only, not live Databricks proof. Its older shared mutation
  map is superseded by scoped mutation evidence in
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/shared-mutation-functional-v342-local/prototype-current-report.json`.
- Current scoped shared mutation-control evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/shared-mutation-functional-v342-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024` with `1` route capture and interaction
  `cross-page-control-contract`. It records `307` visible controls, `0` uncovered
  controls, and updates Stewardship `Comment` and `Resolve` dispositions to
  `disabled with visible prototype work-item rationale; no PATCH submitted`. This is
  local prototype-mock evidence only, not live Databricks proof.
- Shared shell profile-menu evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/all-functional-v122-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024` with interaction `shared-shell-chrome`. It proves the profile
  menu opens and that avatar upload is labeled `Upload local avatar` with an explicit
  local-browser-only title that excludes Databricks profile mutation. This is local
  prototype-mock evidence only, not live Databricks proof.
- Command Center functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/all-functional-v122-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024`, `1440x900`, and `1280x720` with `3` route captures,
  `15` Command Center interaction records. It covers export, Present mode, trend windows,
  info affordances, catalog/domain/risk/CDE/activity routing, lower-scroll CDE/activity
  regions, and Command Center Atlas AI suggestion click, typed prompt, loading, answer,
  evidence, shared topbar search, chrome, and error states. The
  report includes `3` expected `503` Atlas AI error-path responses that are counted as
  expected failures by the harness. This is local prototype-mock evidence only, not live
  Databricks proof.
- Discover functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/all-functional-v122-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024`, `1440x900`, and `1280x720` with `3` route captures and
  `27` loaded Discover interaction specs.
  It covers topbar search preload into Discover, valid/invalid/loading/empty search
  states, facets, reset browse, sort, local favorites, row action menus,
  selected-preview tabs, Asset 360/Governance/Lineage routing, disabled unbacked
  Comment/Request actions, sticky preview footer visibility, bottom-card Atlas AI
  Recommendations execution/evidence routing, selected-preview non-live provenance,
  and floating Atlas AI prompt/evidence from Discover. The report has three expected
  invalid-query `400` responses, one per reviewed viewport, and no page errors. This is
  local prototype-mock evidence only, not live Databricks proof.
- Stewardship functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/all-functional-v122-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024`, `1440x900`, and `1280x720` with `3` route captures and
  `12` Stewardship interaction specs.
  It covers filter/pill/row selection, Bulk assign and New work item unavailable
  panels, Assign owner and Archive suggested-action unavailable panels, visible
  Comment and Resolve disabled states with non-authoritative prototype rationale,
  disabled pagination rationale, affected asset routing, absence of the removed
  non-reference open-lineage-context control, and
  floating Atlas AI prompt/evidence from Stewardship. The shared mutation map is
  narrowed by `docs/northstar_visual_qa/shared-mutation-functional-v342-local/prototype-current-report.json`.
  This is local prototype-mock evidence only, not live Databricks proof.
- Glossary functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/all-functional-v122-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024`, `1440x900`, and `1280x720` with `3` route captures and
  `12` Glossary interaction specs. Supplemental current evidence in
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/taxonomy-functional-v354-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  clicks the reviewer workflow unavailable note, verifies detail close behavior, and
  routes the renamed `Preview lineage` affordance. It covers New term unavailable
  rationale, linked-asset association browsing with source FQN display, reviewer
  workflow, version history, hierarchy unavailable state, lineage preview routing,
  global search, help, profile menu, floating Atlas AI prompt/evidence, and
  responsive card control containment. This is local prototype-mock evidence only,
  not live Databricks proof.
- CDE Registry functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/cde-functional-v225-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024`, `1440x900`, and `1280x720` with `3` route captures and
  `12` CDE Registry interaction specs. Supplemental current evidence in
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/taxonomy-functional-v354-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  clicks the owner and recertification workflow unavailable notes, verifies selected-detail
  close behavior, and routes Lineage with `tab=cdes`. It covers source/detail routing,
  owner and recertification unavailable workflow notes, Lineage routing, CDE-tab
  `+ New term` semantics, absence of the non-reference CDE search/status/sort controls,
  floating Atlas AI prompt/evidence, and responsive table/control containment. This is
  local prototype-mock evidence only, not live Databricks proof.
- Lineage Atlas functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/lineage-functional-v261-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024`, `1440x900`, and `1280x720` with `3` route captures and
  `15` current Lineage interaction records covering control, selected-node/detail,
  Notify Owners, asset-action absence, and Atlas AI interactions.
  It covers the current non-authoritative prototype shape: hidden authoritative-only
  Compare/Table/Search/Export toolbar controls stay absent, visible header Column
  lineage and Run impact analysis controls update state, canvas `+`/`-` mutate graph
  zoom state, `Fit graph` resets zoom, `Graph history` is disabled with a persisted-snapshot
  rationale, timeline `Now` reports useful status, all `9` visible graph
  nodes, `2` details-panel rows, `5` impact rows, and `4` column-lineage rows are
  clicked and recorded, Notify Owners is disabled with backed-impact rationale, the
  former selected-strip `Open asset` action is confirmed absent from the non-authoritative
  prototype topology,
  and floating Atlas AI suggestion, typed prompt, disabled-submit rationale, prototype
  evidence routing, accuracy notice, and close control are exercised. The report records
  `0` console errors, `0` page errors, and `0` request failures. This is local
  prototype-mock evidence only, not live Databricks proof.
- Current deployed Lineage Atlas functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/lineage-restricted-live-v399-databricks/lineage-live-report.json`
  passed against deployed build `frontend-a848646ee695`, deployment
  `01f145c5425111deb3dd027dea2aff20`. It covers the live Lineage route at
  `1536x1024`, `1440x900`, and `1280x720`, with route settle, header
  `Column lineage`, Run impact analysis, canvas zoom/fit, toolbar
  `Table lineage`/`Column lineage`/`Search`/`Export`, a verified JSON evidence
  download, focus-node selection, every visible live graph node class or explicit
  unavailable detail rows, Refocus graph, missing-asset unavailable controls, and
  shared shell controls from Lineage route context. The report had `0` request
  failures, `0` page errors, and `0` console errors. These reports are live
  Databricks evidence for only the exercised controls; remaining visual and
  live-proof blockers stay open in `full_page_audit.md`.
- Audit Evidence functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/audit-functional-v199-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024` and `1280x720` with `2` route captures and `8` Audit Evidence
  interaction specs. It covers date-range menu selection, the `date_range=7d` request
  scope, the visible `Events · 7d` KPI scope, event filters, report and CSV exports,
  selected row detail, request ID copy, selected-detail asset routing, inline evidence
  target routing, and floating Atlas AI prompt/evidence. This is local prototype-mock
  evidence only, not live Databricks proof.
- Current deployed Audit Evidence functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/audit-live-v386-databricks/audit-live-report.json`
  passed against deployed build `frontend-22deff27b4c2`, deployment
  `01f145b7211c1802a5c6116de31d6b00`. It covers the live Audit route settle,
  Audit API RLS/actor-exposure contract, date-range and category controls,
  selected-row/detail actions, report JSON download, and CSV download. The RLS
  interaction records `rowLevelSecurity=visible-assets-only`,
  `actorIdentityExposure=steward-admin-gated`, redacted actor samples, and
  `noUnscopedActorExposure=true`.
- Control Center functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/all-functional-v122-local/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed at `1536x1024`, `1440x900`, and `1280x720` with `3` route captures and
  `12` Control Center interaction specs. It covers prototype URL withholding with
  disabled linked-resource state, no-URL disabled detail, integration and policy
  detail, topbar search, notifications, help, profile menu, floating Atlas AI
  prompt/evidence, and responsive job/integration/policy/detail containment. This is
  local prototype-mock evidence only, not live Databricks proof.
- Local prototype-mock captures are not live Databricks proof.
- Allowed older multi-route live Databricks functional evidence:
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/live-functional-v314-databricks/prototype-current-report.json`
  passed against then-current deployed build `frontend-5f4d8d113643`. It wraps the live API route
  validation at `docs/northstar_visual_qa/live-route-v304-databricks/route-validation.json`
  and deployed browser validation for Discover, Stewardship, Glossary, CDE Registry,
  Lineage, and Audit at the individual report paths listed in
  `docs/northstar_gap_analysis/reference_manifest.json`.
  The API route gate validates the v314 runtime, bootstrap, Asset 360, Lineage,
  Governance, Insights, Taxonomy, CDE, Audit, Admin, Genie, and Lakebase evidence.
  The browser gates validate route controls, truthful empty/unavailable states,
  selected-row/detail workflows, report/CSV downloads, and Lineage thin-data controls
  where those controls are visible in the deployed app. This is live Databricks
  evidence, not prototype-mock evidence.
- Current Lineage-specific live Databricks control evidence is pinned separately at
  `docs/northstar_visual_qa/lineage-restricted-live-v399-databricks/lineage-live-report.json`
  for deployed build `frontend-a848646ee695` after the export-download,
  unavailable-state, restricted-boundary graph-node, and Lineage route-context
  shared-shell updates.
