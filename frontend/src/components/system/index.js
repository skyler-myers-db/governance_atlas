/*
 * Governance Atlas system component kit — Wave A1
 * (docs/architecture/FRONTEND_BLUEPRINT.md §6, COHESION_BLUEPRINT "Three
 * system layers" #1). One kit, one directory, one stylesheet, all
 * `ga-sys-*` classes on `--ga-*` tokens. Dependencies point inward only:
 * nothing in system/ imports from components/* outside system/.
 *
 * The kit ships unused in Wave A by design — consumers arrive in Waves B/C.
 * Do NOT import system.css from main.jsx in this wave; the components
 * import it themselves, so any consumer pulls the styles automatically.
